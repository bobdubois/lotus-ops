## Lotus-ops 
Lotus-ops is a set of Ansible Playbook scripts and Shell scripts that we organize and open source for the deployment and maintenance of Lotus mining software based on our own Lotus operation and maintenance practices. In addition, a complete Filecoin operation and maintenance operation manual is provided for the reference of Filecoin operation and maintenance personnel.

## Features
